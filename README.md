DESCRIPTION:This Java-based recommendation system uses Apache Mahout to suggest items based on user preferences. It loads a dataset of user-item ratings, calculates item-based similarities, and generates personalized recommendations. The system can evaluate its performance using metrics like the average absolute difference.
